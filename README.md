An intro to GitHub for Code Louisville - Sep 2016

Greetings ITers---

I'm a fossil in the IT world having retired after a 32-year career; almost 28 of them at UPS.
I finished as an Application Development Manager so I was a PHB for developers (for >24 years).  
Now I'm considering rejoinging the ranks of the ones-who-code.

Wish me luck, patience, and sanity!
